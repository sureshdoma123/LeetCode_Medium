'''There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:

multiply the number on display by 2, or
subtract 1 from the number on display.
Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.'''

class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, n: int, target: int) -> int:
        res=0
        while n<target:
            if target%2!=0:
                target+=1
            else:
                target//=2
            res+=1
        return res+n-target
